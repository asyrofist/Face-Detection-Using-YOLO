# Face-Detection-Using-YOLO
How to make Face Detection using YOLO algorithm

The Improvement Impact Performance of Face Detection Using YOLO Algorithm described in [our paper at EECSI2020](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9251905). Please kindly cite the following paper when you use this tool. It would also be appreciated if you send me a courtesy [website](http://rakha.asyrofi.com/) and [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WN9T5UUAAAAJ&hl=id&oi=ao), so I could survey what kind of tasks the tool is used for.
